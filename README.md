## Release: v1.0.0 â€“ Modernized GUI & Maintenance Enhancements

### Overview
This initial release introduces a fully modernized GUI that improves the user experience and overall functionality. Key enhancements include a reorganized layout with clearly grouped update tasks and maintenance checks, a dynamic status label that shows the current task, and a progress bar that updates as each task completes.

### Key Enhancements
- **Modernized User Interface:**  
  - Two group boxes separate the update tasks (drivers, software, Chocolatey, and apps) from the maintenance checks (settings, SFC, disk health, performance).  
  - A dynamic status label displays the current task.  
  - A progress bar visually indicates the overall progress of maintenance tasks.  
  - Improved spacing, anchoring, and auto-scrolling ensure that no controls are cut off, even on smaller screens.
  
- **Enhanced Maintenance Features:**  
  - Supports updating drivers and software through Windows Update.  
  - Upgrades all installed Chocolatey packages.  
  - Updates Windows apps using winget (and prompts installation via Microsoft Store if winget is missing).  
  - Checks important Windows settings (e.g., UAC, Windows Update service, and Windows Defender Firewall).  
  - Runs the System File Checker (SFC) and performs diagnostic tests on disk health and system performance.

- **Robust Logging & Error Handling:**  
  - Detailed logging is available both in the GUI and as a log file in the `%TEMP%` folder.
  - Error messages and progress updates help users troubleshoot if any tasks fail.

## Prerequisites

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XeVierCode/SystemMaintenanceForWindows
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   Double-click **SystemMaintenance.bat** and click **Yes** when prompted for administrator permissions.  
   The BAT file launches **Core.ps1**, which contains the GUI and core functionality.

3. **Using the GUI:**

   - Read the instructions displayed at the top of the application.
   - Use the **Update Tasks** group to run individual update tasks (Drivers, Software, Chocolatey, and Windows Apps).
   - Use the **Maintenance Checks** group for system diagnostics (Settings, SFC, Disk Health, Performance).
   - Click the **Run All Maintenance Tasks** button to execute all tasks sequentially. The status label will indicate the current task, and the progress bar will update accordingly.
   - View logs in the log box; a complete log is saved to the `%TEMP%` folder.

4. **Post-Maintenance:**

   If any task indicates that a reboot is required, please restart your computer to complete the updates.
